# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project - Movie Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a comprehensive movie dataset using an interactive Python notebook. The objective was to analyze the dataset, visualize insights, and highlight key findings related to movie trends. The deliverable is a single **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)**, thoroughly documented and commented for accessibility.

### Key Tasks Performed
1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and examined the movie dataset to understand its structure, including columns, data types, and general statistics.
2. **Data Visualisation**: Created Python-based visualisations to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights within the data.
3. **Key Observations**: Extracted two major findings and explored their significance.
4. **Movie Deep Dive**: Conducted an in-depth analysis of two specific movies to compare their attributes and understand their uniqueness.

## Notebook Features

### 1. **Data Exploration**
- Utilised Python libraries such as `pandas` to load and explore the dataset.
- Reviewed key statistics such as missing values, duplicates, and summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
- Provided initial observations regarding the movie dataset.

### 2. **Visualisations**
The notebook features **3 Python visualisations** that showcase key insights drawn from the data:
- **Visualisation 1**: Trends in movie release years and production volume over time.
- **Visualisation 2**: Distribution of movie ratings and their relationship with genres.
- **Visualisation 3**: Top-performing movies based on revenue or ratings, segmented by key attributes such as genre or production studio.

Visualiasations were created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to ensure clarity and accessibility.

### 3. **Key Findings**
- **Key Point 1**: Identified the most interesting or surprising trend in the data (e.g., a genre's dominance, revenue growth, or rating distribution).
- **Key Point 2**: Analyzed another significant insight, such as the performance of movies by production studio, year, or region.

Both key findings were explicitly detailed using **Markdown** and visualized with appropriate charts to explain their relevance.

### 4. **In-Depth Movie Analysis**
Selected **two movies** for a deeper single-observation analysis:
- Provided a detailed breakdown of the attributes for each movie (e.g., revenue, ratings, and genre).
- Compared these movies to similar titles to highlight what makes them unique or significant.
- Discussed trends like rating performance, critical reception, and box office performance.

### 5. **Documentation and Annotations**
- The notebook is **fully annotated** with clear Markdown explanations and inline comments.
- Each step of the analysis is described to ensure the notebook is accessible and easy to interpret.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive Python environment for EDA.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualisation libraries for creating graphs and charts.
- **Markdown**: Used for documentation, descriptions, and key observations.

## Deliverable
- **1 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** file containing:
  - Data exploration and cleaning.
  - 3 Python visualisations with insights.
  - 2 key findings explicitly stated and explained.
  - Detailed analysis of 2 selected movies.

## Conclusion
This project successfully explored and visualised insights from a movie dataset, combining Python programming and data storytelling. The notebook delivers a clear, well-documented analysis that highlights key trends, findings, and deep-dive observations into selected movies, showcasing strong data wrangling and visualisation skills.
